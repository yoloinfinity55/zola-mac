## 🧭 Introduction
As we navigate the complexities of life, it's easy to get caught up in the present moment and forget about the legacy we leave behind. However, the reality is that our time on this earth is limited, and one day, our existence will come to an end. The question is, what will we leave behind, and how will our stories be told? This is where the concept of documenting our lives comes in, and in a recent video, "Linux user preparing for his Death | feat. zola," the creator explores the idea of writing a digital journal as a way to preserve our thoughts, experiences, and emotions for future generations. In this article, we'll delve into the key takeaways from the video and provide a step-by-step guide on how to create your own digital journal using Zola.

The video covers the importance of documenting our lives, the benefits of using a digital journal, and a practical guide on how to set up a Zola-based journal. The creator shares his personal experience of starting a journal and provides tips on how to make the process easier and more efficient. By the end of this article, you'll have a clear understanding of why documenting your life is essential, how to create a digital journal, and the best practices to keep in mind.

As we explore the concept of digital journaling, it's essential to understand that this is not just about writing down your thoughts and feelings; it's about creating a legacy that can be shared with others, even after you're gone. By documenting your life, you're giving future generations a glimpse into your experiences, struggles, and triumphs, which can be a valuable resource for learning and growth. In the following sections, we'll break down the steps to create a digital journal, share key insights and best practices, and discuss when to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown
Here are the main steps to create a digital journal using Zola:
1. **Install Zola**: The first step is to install Zola on your computer, which is a static site generator that allows you to create a website from your journal entries.
2. **Create a GitHub repository**: The creator provides a GitHub repository that contains a template for your journal, which you can clone and customize to your needs.
3. **Set up your journal structure**: You'll need to create a directory for your journal entries, and Zola will take care of generating the website from your entries.
4. **Write your journal entries**: Using a text editor, you can start writing your journal entries, which can be as simple or as detailed as you like.
5. **Use a macro to automate the process**: To make the process easier, you can create a macro that generates a new file with the current date and time, allowing you to quickly write and save your entries.
6. **Sync your journal with a server**: To make sure your journal is accessible online, you can set up a sync process that updates your server with your latest entries.
7. **Customize your journal's appearance**: Finally, you can customize the look and feel of your journal by editing the CSS file and adding your own styles.

## 💡 Key Insights & Best Practices
Here are some actionable takeaways to keep in mind when creating your digital journal:
* **Make the process easy and efficient**: Automate as much as possible, and use tools like macros to minimize the time it takes to write and save your entries.
* **Keep your journal online and anonymous**: This will allow you to be honest and authentic in your writing, without worrying about what others might think.
* **Use a consistent format**: Develop a consistent format for your entries, including the date, time, and any other relevant details.
* **Don't worry about grammar or spelling**: Your journal is for your eyes only, so don't worry about making mistakes – just focus on getting your thoughts down on paper.
* **Make it a habit**: Try to write in your journal regularly, even if it's just a few sentences a day.
* **Keep your journal private**: While it's okay to share your journal with others, make sure you have control over who can access it and when.
* **Back up your journal**: Make sure to back up your journal regularly, in case something happens to your computer or server.

## 🎯 When to Apply This
This knowledge is essential for anyone who wants to leave a lasting legacy, whether you're a writer, artist, or simply someone who wants to document their life. If you're looking for a way to preserve your thoughts, experiences, and emotions for future generations, then creating a digital journal is an excellent way to do so. This is particularly useful for individuals who value their privacy and want to maintain control over their personal stories. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can create a digital journal that will outlast you, providing a unique perspective on your life and times.

Hey guys welcome to my channel. So I don't know why but every time new arrives people start getting this bullshit vibes that they want to change their lives. Well in this video I'm going to tell them to start writing a journal so they can see it every year the same and unless you do something about it it's not gonna change. One day you will die and your existence will get erased from this world. No one will know what kind of person you were, what thoughts you had, what you were doing at this day. No one can figure this out. But if you document your life, if you just write everything, whatever you're feeling every day just not every day. day even two days or three days just write down whatever events happen because life is nothing but just a series of events if you just write down all your not emotions or stuff but at least okay do write whatever you want even and just put it online anonymously so no one who know you personally can read it it's an anonymous site but some random person can read it but he cannot figure out it's you and you're just doing it keep doing it you die and after thousands year of your death someone can look into your life someone can learn from your experience and even if he cannot the fact that your words exist even after thousands year of your death it's beautiful i don't know if you're getting my point or not don't think that instagram will do it for you because you're fake there you're not real just write anonymous diary where you can be real so in this video i'm going to tell you how to do it six months ago i found this site and it's nothing it's just someone's diary i don't even know what's written there but I like the look of the site so because it's minimal so what I did is one month ago I started writing my journal now my reasons were different actually one of my friends was forcing me and I don't write my emotions or stuff I just write whatever I did so if you read this it's actually first of all you cannot read it it's password protected and I edited some portions of it so whatever you're reading it's not actually real so I was talking to my gf but then I woke up so it's just a joke I had it so as you can see so it's it's nothing so but it's really plain minimal site and if you have a domain but you don't really manage your site or anything so you can even use this trick to convert to create some kind of like instagram like website so instead of writing anything you can also put pictures or videos it super simple to do it so i did this with zola but you might think okay you are doing this with zola that means it's not minimal or it's but the thing is it is actually very minimal so this is a github repo i created you can just clone this repo if you understand zola then it's super simple for you if you don't know you can watch my videos on zola or you can just do this actually you you should learn how to use zola otherwise it will be hard but you can find some other ways but i will recommend you to put it online so any random person can read it but anonymously because if people who know you can read it then it's an issue because they will know what you have to say about them so uh your personal thought you know what it's so cool like you're dying okay you are about to die you just tell them like whoever is in front of you you just give him a domain and you're like read everything you know whatever you have to say about him so so here you can see this is what you have to edit so let me just first run this so first of all you have to install zola it's already installed in my computer and then zola serve this is the command in this clone repo so if you run it okay so as you can see this is just the template which i provided in this repo so you can just use this template and create an entire site out of it it's also going to have all the next pages and stuff um so i'm just going to show you how i do it i recommend you to learn a little bit not a lot at least how the basics is working so in the content you just have to create uh the wait a second it is this date command i have so you have to create okay one second date oh god yeah this is the command so this is going to create your title but you don't want title actually you want file name which looks something like this all right so md and just also get the time so time can be 3 and 43 yeah 35 whatever works so this is the file and this is just an entry so in this entry now you might think oh this is so much to do i don know how to do this well it actually not so much because you will use whatever text editor you use you are going to make a macro for it all right so i'll show you my text editor like how i do it but you will you will get it okay so let me show you the state command so yeah what you have to do is in the title you have to put the state something like this in case if you want this format then this otherwise find your own format and then here you can write the markdown so markdown is like this is my first entry so i don't know if it's going to work or not because i haven't tested it but yeah so i did add it okay i added one entry let's just run zola serve and see so here you can see my first entry so if you keep adding entry you will get all the next pages and stuff this is you have to edit in the template you have to remove this you have to change the date and everything even you you have to okay where's this template directory uh this diary you even have to change this like description author name i mean if somebody noticed that would be really embarrassing okay so if you if you just want to edit css then this is the css file it's nothing also yeah that's it so you can just do this now let me show you how I write this so you have to make sure the amount of time it take you to write an entry have to be minimal so suppose if the day is about to end and I'm just in front of my computer and I decided today I'm going to write a diary or log because some event happen or I just write it in every second day usually so what you can do is let me show you so in my emacs i have this thing oh let me open my config so log entry all right it's log diary okay so i have this function which i created now i don't know how vim users are going to do this but in my emacs it's pretty simple i just run this function it creates a file in my diary and as you can see the file name is actually going to get generated by this function format time string and yeah i going to open a file so let me just run it and i also going to enter the title by automatically so if i run this it's going to be something like this and this file is not saved right now so if i type something this is my entry and if i save it right now then you know it will go on my website so i have a sync thing running so it sync my site directory with my server site directory so nothing i have to do it and i realized one thing if you automate everything and if you just minimize the time which you have to spend in order to write an entry then it will help you to create the habit so i'll definitely recommend you to do this so wait a second i have a cron job running which is going to build a site for me from zola on the server so if you find all this very tempting just don't write it on a you know diary physical diary otherwise you know it won't be so see if you put it online or digitally you can make copies you can host it in multiple places you can make sure someone will read it someone can access this after you die all right but or you know what why we think the death will come after 50 years like you can die tomorrow tomorrow is like first day of 2023 pretty bad day to die but you know new resolution maybe like somebody die who all right so all right so what I'm trying to say is uh yeah so yeah don't write it on diary otherwise nobody is going to read it even after thousands here it's going to die anyway write it on digitally on an anonymous site keep it online um yeah so yeah that's it so sync it minimize the time to write it and keep writing the diary write your emotions don't do teenage rants but fine like just write whatever you want alright that's the video and the github repo i'll put the link in the description thanks for watching
