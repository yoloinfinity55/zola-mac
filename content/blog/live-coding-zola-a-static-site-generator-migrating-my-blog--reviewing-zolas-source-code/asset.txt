hey there hey there hey there it's modern radford and today i will try it's modern radford and today i will try it's modern radford and today i will try to do something new to do something new to do something new i'm very fascinated fascinated about i'm very fascinated fascinated about i'm very fascinated fascinated about rust ecosystem rust ecosystem rust ecosystem and um one thing that i wanted to do for and um one thing that i wanted to do for and um one thing that i wanted to do for some time now some time now some time now is to showcase some of the good is to showcase some of the good is to showcase some of the good applications applications applications libraries um and tools that are made in libraries um and tools that are made in libraries um and tools that are made in rust so today we will look at zola which rust so today we will look at zola which rust so today we will look at zola which is a is a is a static site generator written in rust i static site generator written in rust i static site generator written in rust i will try to migrate my blog from jekyll will try to migrate my blog from jekyll will try to migrate my blog from jekyll to it to it to it and time permits and we will also look and time permits and we will also look and time permits and we will also look inside it and inside it and inside it and try to figure out how it works and do a try to figure out how it works and do a try to figure out how it works and do a bit of a bit of a bit of a little code review with that so let's little code review with that so let's little code review with that so let's start here you can see zola itself it has this here you can see zola itself it has this here you can see zola itself it has this nice website called getzola nice website called getzola nice website called getzola [Music] [Music] [Music] in essence you have a bunch of things in essence you have a bunch of things in essence you have a bunch of things here so here so here so you have a bit of typical landing page you have a bit of typical landing page you have a bit of typical landing page no dependencies blazing fast scalable no dependencies blazing fast scalable no dependencies blazing fast scalable easy to use flexible augmented markdown easy to use flexible augmented markdown easy to use flexible augmented markdown blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and i guess we can jump right in and try and i guess we can jump right in and try and i guess we can jump right in and try to to to install it well i already installed it install it well i already installed it install it well i already installed it via first binary thing because i wanted via first binary thing because i wanted via first binary thing because i wanted to see what experience is like but if we to see what experience is like but if we to see what experience is like but if we run it i guess um we are using homebrew run it i guess um we are using homebrew run it i guess um we are using homebrew because i'm on because i'm on because i'm on mac os so nothing super fancy there mac os so nothing super fancy there mac os so nothing super fancy there now i have a blog which is now i have a blog which is now i have a blog which is like a.net and here you can see like a.net and here you can see like a.net and here you can see we have a couple of posts so we have a couple of posts so we have a couple of posts so essentially i migrated my medium block essentially i migrated my medium block essentially i migrated my medium block here after medium started to become more here after medium started to become more here after medium started to become more and more and more and more weird and added more and more weird and added more and more weird and added more and more restrictions so stop being a content restrictions so stop being a content restrictions so stop being a content distribution platform and became more of distribution platform and became more of distribution platform and became more of uh players to read some article platform uh players to read some article platform uh players to read some article platform so so so yeah i migrated my stuff here on my yeah i migrated my stuff here on my yeah i migrated my stuff here on my own website and i have essentially two own website and i have essentially two own website and i have essentially two articles there that i will try to articles there that i will try to articles there that i will try to migrate migrate migrate now in terms of requirements we need to now in terms of requirements we need to now in terms of requirements we need to be able to use markdown be able to use markdown be able to use markdown so those articles are marked down so those articles are marked down so those articles are marked down and we also need to be able to highlight and we also need to be able to highlight and we also need to be able to highlight code because well i'm writing technical code because well i'm writing technical code because well i'm writing technical blood blocks so blood blocks so blood blocks so we need code highlighting we need to be we need code highlighting we need to be we need code highlighting we need to be able to able to able to host images because sometimes i add host images because sometimes i add host images because sometimes i add diagrams and sometimes i add diagrams and sometimes i add diagrams and sometimes i add just random stuff like embeds as well just random stuff like embeds as well just random stuff like embeds as well and that's pretty much it i think we and that's pretty much it i think we and that's pretty much it i think we don't need comments we don't need any don't need comments we don't need any don't need comments we don't need any like super like super like super complex functionality i try to not track complex functionality i try to not track complex functionality i try to not track anybody so anybody so anybody so um i hope that we don't need to add any um i hope that we don't need to add any um i hope that we don't need to add any kind of google analytics or anything kind of google analytics or anything kind of google analytics or anything like that like that like that now i host it on github so i use github now i host it on github so i use github now i host it on github so i use github pages for that pages for that pages for that we have this repository names that are we have this repository names that are we have this repository names that are typical when you want to host something typical when you want to host something typical when you want to host something on github and i'm currently using jekyll on github and i'm currently using jekyll on github and i'm currently using jekyll jekyll sucks in many ways jekyll sucks in many ways jekyll sucks in many ways one thing why i also started looking for one thing why i also started looking for one thing why i also started looking for a new static site generator a new static site generator a new static site generator is this amazing scene so you have like is this amazing scene so you have like is this amazing scene so you have like security vulnerabilities i guess i can security vulnerabilities i guess i can security vulnerabilities i guess i can update them but i really don't want to update them but i really don't want to update them but i really don't want to mostly because it was very unpleasant mostly because it was very unpleasant mostly because it was very unpleasant experience sites in this app experience sites in this app experience sites in this app and i want to try this rust solution and i want to try this rust solution and i want to try this rust solution called zola hopefully it will simplify called zola hopefully it will simplify called zola hopefully it will simplify things for me things for me things for me and it should be sufficiently simple to and it should be sufficiently simple to and it should be sufficiently simple to set up set up set up judging by the some posts other people judging by the some posts other people judging by the some posts other people wrote about trying to wrote about trying to wrote about trying to use it so use it so use it so we we can see that zola has already been we we can see that zola has already been we we can see that zola has already been installed installed installed so i guess we can jump into docks i so i guess we can jump into docks i so i guess we can jump into docks i haven't tried them properly yet haven't tried them properly yet haven't tried them properly yet so i just look that they seem to have so i just look that they seem to have so i just look that they seem to have all the all the all the features that i want to do uh so that is features that i want to do uh so that is features that i want to do uh so that is good good good i guess um i guess um i guess um we can use the existing wrapper right so we can use the existing wrapper right so we can use the existing wrapper right so i will just create a new branch and here then what do i do with all the and here then what do i do with all the and here then what do i do with all the stuff stuff stuff i guess i can just i have configurable i guess i can just i have configurable i guess i can just i have configurable um so there is this stuff i have this game so there is this stuff i have this game so there is this stuff i have this game file file file because jekyll is running on ruby so because jekyll is running on ruby so because jekyll is running on ruby so those things they will all go those things they will all go those things they will all go out i think this out i think this out i think this is uh some jekyll thing this is also is uh some jekyll thing this is also is uh some jekyll thing this is also okay this is just like about page okay this is just like about page okay this is just like about page and otherwise i only have like posts and otherwise i only have like posts and otherwise i only have like posts that are just normal markdown documents that are just normal markdown documents that are just normal markdown documents so nothing super so nothing super so nothing super fascinating there and of course i need fascinating there and of course i need fascinating there and of course i need to have a space for storing to have a space for storing to have a space for storing my theme well i used minima my theme well i used minima my theme well i used minima i will probably do some css on my own i will probably do some css on my own i will probably do some css on my own includes i think yeah well that's just includes i think yeah well that's just includes i think yeah well that's just header footer blah blah blah header footer blah blah blah header footer blah blah blah and they have assets where for each blog and they have assets where for each blog and they have assets where for each blog post they just put like some images here post they just put like some images here post they just put like some images here so i think so i think so i think that will be one i'm just trying to look that will be one i'm just trying to look that will be one i'm just trying to look out what i currently have so i know how out what i currently have so i know how out what i currently have so i know how to migrate it and to migrate it and to migrate it and what to do about it now now now [Music] what do we do with zola we start with what do we do with zola we start with what do we do with zola we start with command line usage i guess so we can command line usage i guess so we can command line usage i guess so we can emit my emit my emit my site um let's move site um let's move site um let's move stuff to another folder i guess so i stuff to another folder i guess so i stuff to another folder i guess so i will just create will just create will just create legacy and then i can i don't know all this stuff there i don't know all this stuff there i don't know all this stuff there yep then i can move yep then i can move yep then i can move assets to legacy yep and then i can move and then i can move and then i can move mark down files i can move mark down files i can move mark down files i can move empty files and finally and finally and finally so like stuff like cname i will still so like stuff like cname i will still so like stuff like cname i will still need because need because need because this is what allows my lucky github bio this is what allows my lucky github bio this is what allows my lucky github bio thing thing thing to point to a correct to point to a correct to point to a correct folder um sorry to use the correct folder um sorry to use the correct folder um sorry to use the correct hostname like red.net hostname like red.net hostname like red.net so that's stuff i will still need but so that's stuff i will still need but so that's stuff i will still need but for now just to for now just to for now just to see what we get i also moved it inside see what we get i also moved it inside see what we get i also moved it inside this legacy folder this legacy folder this legacy folder license as well license as well license as well and finally um let's move again file and finally um let's move again file and finally um let's move again file okay so now we have only this thing and okay so now we have only this thing and okay so now we have only this thing and now we can try zona in it now we can try zona in it now we can try zona in it zola in it okay any choices um okay any choices um okay any choices um well please answer a few questions to get please answer a few questions to get please answer a few questions to get started quickly what is your url of your website well we want to enable sas compilation yes we want to enable sas compilation yes we want to enable sas compilation yes syntax highlighting yes yes zola surf okay so let's see what it zola surf okay so let's see what it zola surf okay so let's see what it created created created um let's open it in code maybe i can do it like that so we have uh okay nothing is here it's so we have uh okay nothing is here it's so we have uh okay nothing is here it's completely empty we just have this completely empty we just have this completely empty we just have this config thing zola serve is the way to serve it zola serve is the way to serve it zola serve is the way to serve it done in 29 milliseconds that looks good all right it auto reloads as well this all right it auto reloads as well this all right it auto reloads as well this is really nice we install a theme so what kind of themes do they have you so what kind of themes do they have you so what kind of themes do they have you can find a list of themes here after dark even ergo fuzzer i wonder if they have anything close to i wonder if they have anything close to i wonder if they have anything close to minimal or not minimal or not minimal or not um but [Music] [Music] [Music] slim slim slim pickles zuma i'm not sure if i want to use the theme i'm not sure if i want to use the theme i'm not sure if i want to use the theme to be honest um looks not really nice i'll just look at a couple of those and i'll just look at a couple of those and i'll just look at a couple of those and see if there is something good here simple dev blog pretty much what i want simple dev blog pretty much what i want simple dev blog pretty much what i want to do uh no i don't want this i want to just uh no i don't want this i want to just uh no i don't want this i want to just see yes see yes see yes to see that but i guess [Music] [Music] [Music] because that looks better what if the content folder and then what if the content folder and then what if the content folder and then enable an example content index enable an example content index enable an example content index reference card all the events support cortex which is all the events support cortex which is all the events support cortex which is like like like for showing mathematical formulas which for showing mathematical formulas which for showing mathematical formulas which is pretty nice used instant page okay we can uh see what they have there so index page anchor links index page anchor links index page anchor links okay this is just markdown okay perfect i guess we can try this theme then um to i guess we can try this theme then um to i guess we can try this theme then um to simplify it and also see we simplify it and also see we simplify it and also see we can always then of course change it can always then of course change it can always then of course change it however we want because it seems that it however we want because it seems that it however we want because it seems that it just installs a bunch of templates here just installs a bunch of templates here just installs a bunch of templates here so that's nice so that's nice so that's nice themes directory okay you can actually switch now to proper you can actually switch now to proper you can actually switch now to proper editor right um editor right um editor right um i also make it a bit larger so that you i also make it a bit larger so that you i also make it a bit larger so that you can see what i'm doing can see what i'm doing can see what i'm doing a bit better so if we go and yeah let's then disable so if we go and yeah let's then disable so if we go and yeah let's then disable this stuff this stuff this stuff do it here now we can go to themes and we can then get we can go to themes and we can then get we can go to themes and we can then get clone clone clone blah blah blah blah blah blah oh sure give clone the scene oh sure give clone the scene oh sure give clone the scene we got a bunch of things now i don't we got a bunch of things now i don't we got a bunch of things now i don't want it to be a want it to be a want it to be a git rapper because it may be problematic git rapper because it may be problematic git rapper because it may be problematic so for us so i would just so for us so i would just so for us so i would just do this now let's remove apache thing let's remove apache thing let's remove apache thing okay okay okay [Music] [Music] [Music] and that's pretty much that now that what we need to add here okay oh okay oh okay oh this is interesting so um should i just restart this thing section pick lambda content index field variable paginator pages in front field variable paginator pages in front field variable paginator pages in front and contact or entering index.html and contact or entering index.html and contact or entering index.html so theme has broken our website so theme has broken our website so theme has broken our website that is funny uh let's see if we can fix that is funny uh let's see if we can fix that is funny uh let's see if we can fix it it it so maybe i'm doing some strong it's to say maybe i'm doing some strong it's to say maybe i'm doing some strong it's to say the theme variables the theme variables the theme variables the same thing has to be his name which the same thing has to be his name which the same thing has to be his name which actually clones him in for example actually clones him in for example actually clones him in for example i think him simple customizing it him i think him simple customizing it him i think him simple customizing it him in the configuration um because i may in the configuration um because i may in the configuration um because i may have screwed up configuration have screwed up configuration have screwed up configuration no i didn't i think it's on only pickles yeah so pickles okay generated fit taxonomies i feel that generated fit taxonomies i feel that generated fit taxonomies i feel that via paginator pages okay let's via paginator pages okay let's via paginator pages okay let's do quick search for that ah thing do quick search for that ah thing do quick search for that ah thing and hopefully um maybe it's mentioned in issues so there maybe it's mentioned in issues so there maybe it's mentioned in issues so there are three closed issues are three closed issues are three closed issues okay interesting uh it seems that we don't interesting uh it seems that we don't interesting uh it seems that we don't have much have much have much things here that point us to things here that point us to things here that point us to how to use it let's try zola report itself now just search for that okay it looks to me like this is some okay it looks to me like this is some okay it looks to me like this is some kind of error kind of error kind of error in the theme um for now i don't even care about for now i don't even care about for now i don't even care about pagination right i can just pagination right i can just pagination right i can just um in essence i can just um in essence i can just um in essence i can just put stuff on one page for now i won't be put stuff on one page for now i won't be put stuff on one page for now i won't be producing more than like producing more than like producing more than like 20 blog posts for i think a year or so 20 blog posts for i think a year or so 20 blog posts for i think a year or so so this problem so this problem so this problem is not really relevant to me okay um is not really relevant to me okay um is not really relevant to me okay um let's not spend too much time on trying let's not spend too much time on trying let's not spend too much time on trying this theme it didn't work this theme it didn't work this theme it didn't work i guess i'll just drop it and let's try to do it i'll just drop it and let's try to do it i'll just drop it and let's try to do it ourselves and see if it works ourselves and see if it works ourselves and see if it works so um so um so um no okay skipping themes now no okay skipping themes now no okay skipping themes now this is all fascinating but let's try to see if our website now will let's try to see if our website now will let's try to see if our website now will work work work if i do oh yeah i need to remove this if i do oh yeah i need to remove this if i do oh yeah i need to remove this thing of course thing of course thing of course and then i can do solar serve and then i can do solar serve and then i can do solar serve and this and this and this should now work okay we are back to should now work okay we are back to should now work okay we are back to working state i guess i guess i guess let's close this stuff and see so let's close this stuff and see so let's close this stuff and see so only hidden files they will try to only hidden files they will try to only hidden files they will try to populate so populate so populate so you need force blah blah blah and you need force blah blah blah and you need force blah blah blah and rebuild then rebuild then rebuild then serve that we already did serve that we already did serve that we already did [Music] [Music] [Music] then we can start looking at then we can start looking at then we can start looking at sections and something else so directory structure is something else so directory structure is something else so directory structure is useful useful useful configuration overview section pages configuration overview section pages configuration overview section pages okay contains all your markup content so i guess we can start by trying to put i guess we can start by trying to put i guess we can start by trying to put some stuff some stuff some stuff in the content directory in the content directory in the content directory and then if it works we will know um and then if it works we will know um and then if it works we will know um so i will just take the i will open my legacy folder here and then i can go to posts i can select this stuff and i can move i can select this stuff and i can move i can select this stuff and i can move it so one directory up one directory up it so one directory up one directory up it so one directory up one directory up then we have big lambda and then we have then we have big lambda and then we have then we have big lambda and then we have content and those are here now um and those are here now um and those are here now um they should be a bit broken something they should be a bit broken something they should be a bit broken something broke broke broke again it's okay couldn't find front meter it's okay couldn't find front meter it's okay couldn't find front meter in uh did you forget to add source none that didn't like something those are that didn't like something those are that didn't like something those are like normal like normal like normal markdown files i think i didn't think markdown files i think i didn't think markdown files i think i didn't think that i had something oh we have this like site url stuff here oh we have this like site url stuff here oh we have this like site url stuff here um for the test to it let's try to um for the test to it let's try to um for the test to it let's try to rename it rename it rename it and call it like so now i and call it like so now i and call it like so now i think don't show again i'll just rename those don't show again i'll just rename those don't show again i'll just rename those files files files and i will see if that helps us and i will see if that helps us and i will see if that helps us so if i do so surf let's just put some really dumb um let's just put some really dumb um let's just put some really dumb um thing here let's just do test let's just do test let's just do test me there so this me there so this me there so this oh so when you update oh so when you update oh so when you update what oopsie uh what oopsie uh what oopsie uh did you forget to add okay i guess we did you forget to add okay i guess we did you forget to add okay i guess we need to read some docs here rains pages so content block and lens in content block and lens in content block and lens in oh okay oh okay oh okay so you so you so you don't have a simple thing where you don't have a simple thing where you don't have a simple thing where you put [Music] [Music] [Music] markdown pages do you have more complex markdown pages do you have more complex markdown pages do you have more complex structure okay um okay must be this documentation makes me okay must be this documentation makes me okay must be this documentation makes me a bit confused um a bit confused um a bit confused um i wonder if i'm missing so i wonder if i'm missing so i wonder if i'm missing so this is like beginning of our dark sort this is like beginning of our dark sort this is like beginning of our dark sort so this is like

dark let's see that maybe it actually also looks okay now as you have dark but not light now as you have dark but not light now as you have dark but not light interesting fine let's keep it for now because it is fine let's keep it for now because it is fine let's keep it for now because it is at least not super ugly at least not super ugly at least not super ugly um one thing that i'm not sure about is um one thing that i'm not sure about is um one thing that i'm not sure about is does it have any other settings for this scene so we avoid configuration so otherwise we cannot really configure so otherwise we cannot really configure so otherwise we cannot really configure it it it and by default of course this looks uh and by default of course this looks uh and by default of course this looks uh very ugly very ugly very ugly especially this dark theme because it especially this dark theme because it especially this dark theme because it doesn't have any padding whatsoever doesn't have any padding whatsoever doesn't have any padding whatsoever i wonder if i can fix it via i wonder if i can fix it via i wonder if i can fix it via oh okay so it uses a spray thin and oh okay so it uses a spray thin and oh okay so it uses a spray thin and cold things so i can do then uh cold things so i can do then uh cold things so i can do then uh i guess i can try to fix it on this i guess i can try to fix it on this i guess i can try to fix it on this level to encode pads in and just doing like one remove pads in and just doing like one remove pads in and just doing like one remove parting parting parting everywhere oopsie or maybe okay that looks way better okay that looks way better okay that looks way better then of course i also wanted to make then of course i also wanted to make then of course i also wanted to make sure that i probably want to make a bit of border i probably want to make a bit of border i probably want to make a bit of border radius here radius here radius here right so okay i can actually close the right so okay i can actually close the right so okay i can actually close the stuff and make a bit more stuff and make a bit more stuff and make a bit more space space space so as in a bit of border radius so so as in a bit of border radius so so as in a bit of border radius so i don't know let's say i don't know let's say i don't know let's say 20 pixels 20 pixels 20 pixels so okay that looks nicer now do you want to check any other major now do you want to check any other major now do you want to check any other major features here so i'm pretty sure okay we features here so i'm pretty sure okay we features here so i'm pretty sure okay we can add about page we can probably add some basic styling we can probably add some basic styling we can probably add some basic styling for this for this for this blog page quickly by the way what is this oh they also by the way what is this oh they also by the way what is this oh they also have search okay that's different okay that's different okay that's different oh yeah i guess we lost images on our as a blog post so yeah we've lost images here i wonder if i can just try to put it i wonder if i can just try to put it i wonder if i can just try to put it here uh served i'm trying to find how they work with i'm trying to find how they work with i'm trying to find how they work with assets assets assets but that is not but that is not but that is not that easy maybe it's in page somewhere in section forever here section drafts in sorting sorting blah blah blah sorting sorting blah blah blah sorting sorting blah blah blah page pass from front matter page pass from front matter page pass from front matter our case so they have like different our case so they have like different our case so they have like different configurations available for them configurations available for them configurations available for them using shortcuts overview or assets using shortcuts overview or assets using shortcuts overview or assets collocation so like assets are in collocation so like assets are in collocation so like assets are in overview fine okay so we can collocate some with those so we can collocate some with those so we can collocate some with those things okay configuration actually can i create like configuration actually can i create like configuration actually can i create like a directory for one thing so if i say a directory for one thing so if i say a directory for one thing so if i say oh so i'm thinking oh so i'm thinking oh so i'm thinking if i just create a subdirectory here move it here rename it to index will it still work rename it to index will it still work rename it to index will it still work okay well it does splendid it does splendid it does splendid just for fun let's check it just for fun let's check it just for fun let's check it okay we are live that thing okay we are live that thing okay we are live that thing um because then i can put images here um because then i can put images here um because then i can put images here so then i can create uh elixir so then i can create uh elixir so then i can create uh elixir whatsoever it's in toolbox empty whatsoever it's in toolbox empty whatsoever it's in toolbox empty oh gosh move it here i can call it move it here i can call it move it here i can call it index and then index and then index and then when i look at this scene so we can now move stuff around so we can now move stuff around so we can now move stuff around we can look at the drafts includes layouts includes layouts includes layouts assets yes so for modularity assets yes so for modularity assets yes so for modularity okay that's actually better that's way okay that's actually better that's way okay that's actually better that's way better because then i can really better because then i can really better because then i can really collocate them and then collocate them and then collocate them and then i will have way less trouble uh i can i will have way less trouble uh i can i will have way less trouble uh i can put it here put it here put it here and i can put it there and i can put it there and i can put it there so this is my modularity thing [Music] sure splendid so now i should be able to simplify my pass a bit yay we have images this is nice let's create a subdirectory here sure because then i think we can just sure because then i think we can just sure because then i think we can just do stuff like that we have images here so this scene uh so that doesn't show okay but this does i guess it just ignores but this does i guess it just ignores but this does i guess it just ignores the folder pass which is the folder pass which is the folder pass which is interesting okay interesting okay interesting okay now when i change it that should be now when i change it that should be now when i change it that should be shown here okay okay i guess um you can then just put them in you can then just put them in you can then just put them in subdirectories without specifying them subdirectories without specifying them subdirectories without specifying them interesting interesting interesting but okay and but okay and but okay and link is still okay link works perfectly link is still okay link works perfectly link is still okay link works perfectly images have been restored embed images have been restored embed images have been restored embed is shown of course right now the of course right now the of course right now the markup itself is very ugly markup itself is very ugly markup itself is very ugly you probably want to at least restrict you probably want to at least restrict you probably want to at least restrict the the the i wonder actually if i can set i wonder actually if i can set i wonder actually if i can set stuff here like for example stuff here like for example stuff here like for example in my blog page what do i want i want to in my blog page what do i want i want to in my blog page what do i want i want to say say say i have content splendid then i have like i have content splendid then i have like i have content splendid then i have like subtitle with state spanish i have page subtitle with state spanish i have page subtitle with state spanish i have page content content content so here i will just create a gif and i so here i will just create a gif and i so here i will just create a gif and i will give it a class will give it a class will give it a class saying that this is actually is there saying that this is actually is there saying that this is actually is there maybe there is already some kind of maybe there is already some kind of maybe there is already some kind of class here class container for the whole thing class container for the whole thing class container for the whole thing and here it's just like okay it's not and here it's just like okay it's not and here it's just like okay it's not containing anything yet containing anything yet containing anything yet so we can say so we can say so we can say [Music] i don't know oh let's call it article so it will we oh let's call it article so it will we oh let's call it article so it will we will have will have will have class article and class article and class article and let's just set widths to be let's just set widths to be let's just set widths to be i don't know hi i don't know hi i don't know hi um just not just a comment sorry um just not just a comment sorry um just not just a comment sorry how are you doing today so let's let's set it to so let's let's set it to so let's let's set it to like 90. no this is like 90. no this is text for text it doesn't make sense to text for text it doesn't make sense to text for text it doesn't make sense to just make it just make it just make it wider and white right you probably wider and white right you probably wider and white right you probably should set it to something should set it to something should set it to something sensible so like i don't know sensible so like i don't know sensible so like i don't know that will probably be a little bit too that will probably be a little bit too that will probably be a little bit too too small too small too small yes it is let's set it to like let's set it to like let's set it to like okay this is too much okay this is too much okay this is too much actually let's make it a bit smaller actually let's make it a bit smaller actually let's make it a bit smaller so that already looks good um well so that already looks good um well so that already looks good um well better better better uh i guess uh i guess uh i guess you probably also want to put it in the you probably also want to put it in the you probably also want to put it in the middle of the middle of the middle of the page right um page right um page right um you probably want to put the whole thing you probably want to put the whole thing you probably want to put the whole thing in the middle of the page actually so how do we call that let's go drop r how do we call that let's go drop r how do we call that let's go drop r because we already have container from because we already have container from because we already have container from zola itself so we need to be zola itself so we need to be zola itself so we need to be a bit careful this name in here so then a bit careful this name in here so then a bit careful this name in here so then this wrapper thing the display this flex flex direction column splendid and then we can make it so that it's and then we can make it so that it's and then we can make it so that it's also flex gosh i haven't caught it for web flex gosh i haven't caught it for web flex gosh i haven't caught it for web for so long now i for so long now i for so long now i forgot how to forgot how to forgot how to make it centered gosh oh make it centered gosh oh make it centered gosh oh that happens uh i think let me that happens uh i think let me that happens uh i think let me thankfully for flexbox there is thankfully for flexbox there is thankfully for flexbox there is a very good guide a very good guide a very good guide let me find it quickly let me find it quickly let me find it quickly found it so yeah this is found it so yeah this is found it so yeah this is complete guide to flexbox and order flextrap and order flextrap and order flextrap justify content yes justify the line justify content yes justify the line justify content yes justify the line okay okay okay so uh justify content we are going so uh justify content we are going so uh justify content we are going column we need to justify column we need to justify column we need to justify on a secondary axis so that will be on a secondary axis so that will be on a secondary axis so that will be align align align items i think let's try it okay that looks a bit better our images are still insane but this of course this is also a bit but this of course this is also a bit but this of course this is also a bit insane um let's move let's move let's move so we have page title and page subtitle so we have page title and page subtitle so we have page title and page subtitle right uh right uh right uh so like different things so let's put so like different things so let's put so like different things so let's put them in one diff so that we don't get them in one diff so that we don't get them in one diff so that we don't get the huge space between them that's stuff you don't need that looks a bit weird i think we that looks a bit weird i think we that looks a bit weird i think we probably should just drop this stuff probably should just drop this stuff probably should just drop this stuff that we have here well okay for now i will keep it don't want to for now i will keep it don't want to for now i will keep it don't want to spend too much time with that because spend too much time with that because spend too much time with that because as long as our main layout makes sense as long as our main layout makes sense as long as our main layout makes sense it's alright it's alright it's alright now the main thing for us is to make now the main thing for us is to make now the main thing for us is to make images fit images fit images fit so what is happening with that so it's inside a b inside an article so it's inside a b inside an article so it's inside a b inside an article so paragraph image so paragraph image so paragraph image it doesn't have any width or height set it doesn't have any width or height set it doesn't have any width or height set so maybe if i just try to so maybe if i just try to so maybe if i just try to give all images some kind of yex no it just shows with native bits yex no it just shows with native bits yex no it just shows with native bits uh if i just say okay uh if i just say okay uh if i just say okay go no nothing happens this is a bit weird let me try to okay that works oh my god not image okay that works oh my god not image okay that works oh my god not image img of course img of course img of course let's extract a variable for our article let's extract a variable for our article let's extract a variable for our article bits right bits right bits right um so it will be 60 ram because then we can it will be 60 ram because then we can it will be 60 ram because then we can use it for images and images and images and for article itself so that by the way for article itself so that by the way for article itself so that by the way the main the main the main reason why we are using um sas is to reason why we are using um sas is to reason why we are using um sas is to set those variables okay this looks set those variables okay this looks set those variables okay this looks better well slightly better this still looks well slightly better this still looks well slightly better this still looks ugly i probably need to make it ugly i probably need to make it ugly i probably need to make it a proper syntax highlighter thing a proper syntax highlighter thing a proper syntax highlighter thing it's not nearly important okay i still need to like make this big okay i still need to like make this big okay i still need to like make this big i still need to improve my text style i still need to improve my text style i still need to improve my text style i probably can actually do one thing um actually yeah that probably will be a actually yeah that probably will be a actually yeah that probably will be a bit nicer okay then of course i can also make like each then of course i can also make like each then of course i can also make like each one i can actually okay that i can set really for actually okay that i can set really for actually okay that i can set really for body body body this for h1 i will say i don't know something like that for age 2 i don't know 18. has it been applied okay good actually i can maybe i can maybe i can maybe even what kind of item is that this is what kind of item is that this is what kind of item is that this is also h2 okay it looks a bit more sane but still okay it looks a bit more sane but still okay it looks a bit more sane but still quite ugly quite ugly quite ugly uh i need to i think improve uh i need to i think improve uh i need to i think improve let's do line height 1.5 frame let's do line height 1.5 frame let's do line height 1.5 frame oh um it's not in prime i think it's oh um it's not in prime i think it's oh um it's not in prime i think it's just in numbers right just in numbers right just in numbers right yeah it's just numbers um so 1.5 i think okay that looks way better so now it is already kinda readable we so now it is already kinda readable we so now it is already kinda readable we still have still have still have a bit ugly borders here a bit ugly borders here a bit ugly borders here we don't have all the necessary features we don't have all the necessary features we don't have all the necessary features i have but i have but i have but that's something that we can add with that's something that we can add with that's something that we can add with more css so i won't spend more time on more css so i won't spend more time on more css so i won't spend more time on that that that i think this article looks fine-ish i think this article looks fine-ish i think this article looks fine-ish let's quickly look at see another article so we lost all the pictures so we need so we lost all the pictures so we need so we lost all the pictures so we need to quickly also refactor the to quickly also refactor the to quickly also refactor the picture thing let's also move them to picture thing let's also move them to picture thing let's also move them to images directory so that we images directory so that we images directory so that we have a bit clearer structure have a bit clearer structure have a bit clearer structure here so everybody's there now now so in essence we will need to so how many of those we have we have so how many of those we have we have so how many of those we have we have multiple of those multiple of those multiple of those and we can just replace them all with and we can just replace them all with and we can just replace them all with nothing really nothing really nothing really and that should fix our page so yep we've got so yep we've got so yep we've got images here as well i will need images here as well i will need images here as well i will need to proofread it of course to make sure to proofread it of course to make sure to proofread it of course to make sure that everything else is that everything else is that everything else is here but now look it look it starts to here but now look it look it starts to here but now look it look it starts to look fine look fine look fine um we are how long have i been um we are how long have i been um we are how long have i been working on that we are like working on that we are like working on that we are like one hour 31 minutes in one hour 31 minutes in one hour 31 minutes in so that is pretty nice so like so that is pretty nice so like so that is pretty nice so like one and a half hours we got something one and a half hours we got something one and a half hours we got something that is that is that is that looks ok um that looks ok um that looks ok um now one thing that yeah we have this now one thing that yeah we have this now one thing that yeah we have this page we will also need to add more page we will also need to add more page we will also need to add more styles styles styles i will need to figure out how to make it i will need to figure out how to make it i will need to figure out how to make it work work work with the so it has integration with with the so it has integration with with the so it has integration with github pages so that's nice it has integration with so that's nice it has integration with so that's nice it has integration with github action github action github action i think cname thing should start working i think cname thing should start working i think cname thing should start working with me just putting it there with me just putting it there with me just putting it there hopefully so that kind of should hopefully so that kind of should hopefully so that kind of should serve the serving part serve the serving part serve the serving part the syntax highlights and so we will the syntax highlights and so we will the syntax highlights and so we will need to add our own theme need to add our own theme need to add our own theme eventually but that's not high priority eventually but that's not high priority eventually but that's not high priority otherwise i think like otherwise i think like otherwise i think like from basic functionality perspective it from basic functionality perspective it from basic functionality perspective it works works works uh it was comparatively it will quickly uh it was comparatively it will quickly uh it was comparatively it will quickly commit the state and then we will do a commit the state and then we will do a commit the state and then we will do a quick rundown through the quick rundown through the quick rundown through the code of zola itself to see how it works so i think everything here yes so let's check out zola itself now let's check out zola itself now let's check out zola itself now i guess we can just go to github and clone it actually probably i want to fork it actually probably i want to fork it actually probably i want to fork it because eventually i want to submit the because eventually i want to submit the because eventually i want to submit the request as in the themes that i want request as in the themes that i want request as in the themes that i want visual studio called light i guess visual studio called light i guess visual studio called light i guess and that means that it should be and that means that it should be and that means that it should be like i guess it's better to just fork like i guess it's better to just fork like i guess it's better to just fork the thing so the thing so the thing so let's fork so here we go i guess we can now clone it wow it's quite a bit of stuff in this wow it's quite a bit of stuff in this wow it's quite a bit of stuff in this trap i wonder what it is so and we can start looking at the code so and we can start looking at the code so and we can start looking at the code fancy fossa modules which won't be fancy fossa modules which won't be fancy fossa modules which won't be opened automatically opened automatically opened automatically oh interesting there is like a bunch of things there is like a bunch of things there is like a bunch of things okay this is for github this is i guess okay this is for github this is i guess okay this is for github this is i guess some completions for some completions for some completions for bash pretty cool stuff bash pretty cool stuff bash pretty cool stuff i have no clue how it works we care i have no clue how it works we care i have no clue how it works we care about mostly about mostly about mostly rust codes though though right i think rust codes though though right i think rust codes though though right i think one thing we can try to run is clock to one thing we can try to run is clock to one thing we can try to run is clock to see what see what see what is happening here is happening here is happening here so um yeah by the way i think clock so um yeah by the way i think clock so um yeah by the way i think clock itself is also written in rust itself is also written in rust itself is also written in rust i actually i don't remember but here you i actually i don't remember but here you i actually i don't remember but here you can see can see can see the we have a lot of markdown i think it the we have a lot of markdown i think it the we have a lot of markdown i think it solves the documentation solves the documentation solves the documentation then we have only 73 rust files then we have only 73 rust files then we have only 73 rust files so like the whole size of it is only 14k so like the whole size of it is only 14k so like the whole size of it is only 14k which is pretty nice i think for the which is pretty nice i think

max yeah good idea use small heuristics max yeah good idea use small heuristics max yeah good idea typically helps with making code a bit typically helps with making code a bit typically helps with making code a bit more readable um let's look at those files now so cargo let's look at those files now so cargo let's look at those files now so cargo to almost shows us to almost shows us to almost shows us what kind of stuff they have builders what kind of stuff they have builders what kind of stuff they have builders shows us what kind of custom build steps shows us what kind of custom build

this target and density to input i guess this is really just like build a is really just like build a is really just like build a thing for checking if it builds thing for checking if it builds thing for checking if it builds uh i wonder if you can run it and i wonder how many dependencies we'll and i wonder how many dependencies we'll and i wonder how many dependencies we'll have because if you look now have because if you look now have because if you look now at cargo tomo we will see that we have a at cargo tomo we will see that we have a at cargo tomo we will see that we have a bunch of bunch of bunch of workspace members so like we have high workspace members so like we have high workspace members so like we have high level dependencies here for this level dependencies here for this level dependencies here for this main sot thing which is just like main sot thing which is just like main sot thing which is just like running the whole thing running the whole thing running the whole

reload static plus taxonomies static plus taxonomies static plus taxonomies library permalinks and here you can see how they create a and here you can see how they create a and here you can see how they create a new thing new thing new thing so they just initialize the structure so library contains all pages and so library contains all pages and so library contains all pages and sections of the site sections of the site sections of the site let's check out how they build it so they just call okay compile sas so they just call okay compile sas so they just call okay compile sas build search index render alias build search index render alias build search index render alias render sections so they take this library they read it so they take this library they read it so they take this library they read it drop section okay so i guess you can drop section okay so i guess you can drop section okay so i guess you can start to see why we had so many start to see why we had so many start to see why we had so many like one thing okay the app is cool it's like one thing okay the app is cool it's like one thing okay the app is cool it's lightweight lightweight lightweight it works fast but we had a number of it works fast but we had a number of it works fast but we had a number of instances where instances where instances where stuff was just like failing and breaking stuff was just like failing and breaking stuff was just like failing and breaking and then we need to restart and then we need to restart and then we need to restart and now we can see why surprises they and now we can see why surprises they and now we can see why surprises they under up under up under up quite a bit actually okay 30 uses of unwrap so all this stuff okay 30 uses of unwrap so all this stuff okay 30 uses of unwrap so all this stuff can fail and in some cases can fail and in some cases can fail and in some cases yeah in some cases maybe you know yeah in some cases maybe you know yeah in some cases maybe you know sometimes you unwrap because he knows sometimes you unwrap because he knows sometimes you unwrap because he knows that it cannot fail but in some cases that it cannot fail but in some cases that it cannot fail but in some cases here i'm sure it just unwrapped because here i'm sure it just unwrapped because here i'm sure it just unwrapped because it was harder to process all possible it was harder to process all possible it was harder to process all possible exceptions exceptions exceptions and that stuff is not so good i wonder and that stuff is not so good i wonder and that stuff is not so good i wonder how many times i'm dropping the whole how many times i'm dropping the whole how many times i'm dropping the whole search search search in the whole code base so let's look in the whole code base so let's look in the whole code base so let's look through components first so 763 results in 38 files so 763 results in 38 files so 763 results in 38 files so that explains a lot so that explains a lot so that explains a lot um and if 800 and if 800 and if 800 so we have like 800 places that can so we have like 800 places that can so we have like 800 places that can potentially fail and we have experienced potentially fail and we have experienced potentially fail and we have experienced quite a few of those when we just added quite a few of those when we just added quite a few of those when we just added files where you didn't expect us and it files where you didn't expect us and it files where you didn't expect us and it just just just failed with some random error or like failed with some random error or like failed with some random error or like you forget to add some specific thing to you forget to add some specific thing to you forget to add some specific thing to the description it expects and it also the description it expects and it also the description it expects and it also fails fails fails so that is the reason for that obviously so that is the reason for that obviously so that is the reason for that obviously um otherwise looking at the code it looks otherwise looking at the code it looks otherwise looking at the code it looks nice nice nice it's quite easy to follow so far let's look at how it builds the let's look at how it builds the let's look at how it builds the so you won't build and now you want so you won't build and now you want so you won't build and now you want to see by the way is it oh we have to see by the way is it oh we have to see by the way is it oh we have built it in the meantime nice so it took four minutes on my nice so it took four minutes on my nice so it took four minutes on my agent machine which is not so long agent machine which is not so long agent machine which is not so long i guess we can run the clean you can see i guess we can run the clean you can see i guess we can run the clean you can see that now it runs very quickly that now it runs very quickly that now it runs very quickly um i wonder if they have any tests i i have a clue but let's try to run it i i have a clue but let's try to run it i i have a clue but let's try to run it oh there are some tests okay so that's oh there are some tests okay so that's oh there are some tests okay so that's good there are good there are good there are 10 tests but fine 10 tests but fine 10 tests but fine [Music] there is test side i wonder where tests are even located as well contained in moderate things so i did like a bunch of things here so i did like a bunch of things here so i did like a bunch of things here right this is for serving things um this is for serving things um this is for serving things um okay and this is for commands so that's what and this is for commands so that's what and this is for commands so that's what we saw we saw we saw because i guess then we have 297 tests because i guess then we have 297 tests because i guess then we have 297 tests in the whole code base but i only in the whole code base but i only in the whole code base but i only executed once because i guess i executed executed once because i guess i executed executed once because i guess i executed them from the them from the them from the directory if i go inside inside inside components insane library components insane library components insane library and if i try to run cargo test while it does that let's continue while it does that let's continue while it does that let's continue looking at our looking at our looking at our build thing see if it got side build thing see if it got side build thing see if it got side build uh we do compile and sauce it's build uh we do compile and sauce it's build uh we do compile and sauce it's not very interesting then we can not very interesting then we can not very interesting then we can render sections so here we go to self render sections so here we go to self render sections so here we go to self library if we read section values into library if we read section values into library if we read section values into parallel iterator so it builds them in parallel iterator so it builds them in parallel iterator so it builds them in parallel parallel parallel we map and then self render section we map and then self render section we map and then self render section so render section it does some kind of side effect because it does some kind of side effect because it does some kind of side effect because it returns result of unit it returns result of unit it returns result of unit it writes files in pass i guess so components is a vector of references so components is a vector of references so components is a vector of references to strings okay file components then we go through pages we do parallel then we go through pages we do parallel then we go through pages we do parallel iterations through them iterations through them iterations through them and then we do render page we get page and then we do render page we get page and then we do render page we get page by key by key by key which is which returns reference to page which is which returns reference to page which is which returns reference to page another thing for us to check out so another thing for us to check out so another thing for us to check out so this is like a representation of one this is like a representation of one this is like a representation of one page that we have page that we have page that we have where is it located it's located also in where is it located it's located also in where is it located it's located also in library library library so library is like the whole site is so library is like the whole site is so library is like the whole site is like meta thing i guess like meta thing i guess like meta thing i guess for compiling and like building things for compiling and like building things for compiling and like building things and library is actual contender and library is actual contender and library is actual contender and the library we have also rayon we and the library we have also rayon we and the library we have also rayon we have tera we have serda have tera we have serda have tera we have serda oh yeah yeah so we got like a bunch of oh yeah yeah so we got like a bunch of oh yeah yeah so we got like a bunch of tests running now in tests running now in tests running now in components okay so we have quite a bit components okay so we have quite a bit components okay so we have quite a bit of tests actually they're just of tests actually they're just of tests actually they're just in separate workspaces which is fine in the library itself what is library like web but for hash set okay cool like web but for hash set okay cool like web but for hash set okay cool it's a bit of a helper macro for it's a bit of a helper macro for it's a bit of a helper macro for creating sets more easily creating sets more easily creating sets more easily we have a dense slot map what the hell we have a dense slot map what the hell we have a dense slot map what the hell is that i never heard about this scene it's from i never heard about this scene it's from i never heard about this scene it's from dance rs dance rs dance rs so it's some kind of library let me quickly find it and we can see let me quickly find it and we can see let me quickly find it and we can see what it does what it does what it does oh gosh i guess we can just go to create sail i guess we can just go to create sail i guess we can just go to create sail and then we can so and then quoted recorded two from dance and then quoted recorded two from dance and then quoted recorded two from dance files is it files is it files is it this scene really or is i uh i wonder this scene really or is i uh i wonder this scene really or is i uh i wonder because maybe i'm mixing something up because maybe i'm mixing something up because maybe i'm mixing something up [Music] i know it's slot map is the name of the crate not slot map is the name of the crate not slot map is the name of the crate not dense dense dense ok rust library provides in three rust library provides in three rust library provides in three containers with persistent unique keys containers with persistent unique keys containers with persistent unique keys to access stored values slot map hop to access stored values slot map hop to access stored values slot map hop slot map and then slot map slot map and then slot map slot map and then slot map but essentially key is a joint that can but essentially key is a joint that can but essentially key is a joint that can be used to later access to remove the be used to later access to remove the be used to later access to remove the values values values insertion deletion and access will take insertion deletion and access will take insertion deletion and access will take a big a big a big o of one time with low overhead great o of one time with low overhead great o of one time with low overhead great for storing collections of objects that for storing collections of objects that for storing collections of objects that need stable safe references but have no need stable safe references but have no need stable safe references but have no clear ownership otherwise clear ownership otherwise clear ownership otherwise such as game entities or graph notes two such as game entities or graph notes two such as game entities or graph notes two secondary maps secondary maps secondary maps are also provided allow you to map are also provided allow you to map are also provided allow you to map faster objects to the keys created by faster objects to the keys created by faster objects to the keys created by one of the stop mass preferred one of the stop mass preferred one of the stop mass preferred so but what's the difference this the map okay you can index by them which is nice okay you can index by them which is nice okay you can index by them which is nice i guess for secondary maps okay so you can like okay so you can like okay so you can like ah i guess you can insert this out okay ah i guess you can insert this out okay ah i guess you can insert this out okay okay i see now so instead of okay i see now so instead of okay i see now so instead of managing the keys and values as you managing the keys and values as you managing the keys and values as you typically do this hash map you can just typically do this hash map you can just typically do this hash map you can just insert stuff and it will auto generate a insert stuff and it will auto generate a insert stuff and it will auto generate a key for you key for you key for you that you can use and then it also have that you can use and then it also have that you can use and then it also have secondary maps provided allow you to map secondary maps provided allow you to map secondary maps provided allow you to map faster objects to the keys created by faster objects to the keys created by faster objects to the keys created by one of the slot maps one of the slot maps one of the slot maps okay this is interesting thing i haven't okay this is interesting thing i haven't okay this is interesting thing i haven't seen before pretty nice seen before pretty nice seen before pretty nice so they use that to so they use that to so they use that to store pages page and section are just structs so page and section are just structs so page and section are just structs so nothing fancy here section also oh yeah so this is like roll content is the so this is like roll content is the so this is like roll content is the content of the page content of the page content of the page okay no surprises okay no surprises okay no surprises we have hash maps for past pages and we have hash maps for past pages and we have hash maps for past pages and paths to sections we initialize stuff and we create new library so that's so that's so that's so that's how we got like this but um so that's how we got like this but um so that's how we got like this but um sorts in based on dates sorts in based on dates sorts in based on dates when we looked at the list of articles when we looked at the list of articles when we looked at the list of articles we had in our blog we had in our blog we had in our blog search section pages and here you can search section pages and here you can search section pages and here you can see those options so you see those options so you see those options so you choose sort by date and that is choose sort by date and that is choose sort by date and that is essentially the code that does it essentially the code that does it essentially the code that does it need and then we have tests okay so far the and then we have tests okay so far the and then we have tests okay so far the code base looks pretty code base looks pretty code base looks pretty nice nice nice [Music] do we want to get 2g printer oh content uh so here it's actually rendering stuff uh so here it's actually rendering stuff uh so here it's actually rendering stuff uh but i think we can also find how it uh but i think we can also find how it uh but i think we can also find how it renders stuff compared it's really easy renders stuff compared it's really easy renders stuff compared it's really easy because it uses so let's skip side i want to look at how it serves things i want to look at how it serves things i want to look at how it serves things and i want to look how the syntax and i want to look how the syntax and i want to look how the syntax highlights highlights highlights because it's the things that we want to because it's the things that we want to because it's the things that we want to change right eventually i'm not sure i change right eventually i'm not sure i change right eventually i'm not sure i will actually try to do it will actually try to do it will actually try to do it today but uh i just want to see how it's today but uh i just want to see how it's today but uh i just want to see how it's done and how complex it will be to add a done and how complex it will be to add a done and how complex it will be to add a new theme new theme new theme for that thing so let's look at so let's look at so let's look at serving thing then i'll just close which project doesn't have utils folder i actually not sure does it serve it i actually not sure does it serve it i actually not sure does it serve it from this scene from side like the tail tell thing for aya here we like the tail tell thing for aya here we like the tail tell thing for aya here we can look at how can look at how can look at how oh okay how long it is 700 lines so here we got into our sync stuff those so here we got into our sync stuff those so here we got into our sync stuff those look like handlers look like handlers look like handlers those i would imagine uh http not found let's look at our not found let's look at our not found let's look at our main thing what god's executed when we main thing what god's executed when we main thing what god's executed when we ask you to serve things this so it creates a new site it finds new address oh wow it finds new address oh wow it finds new address oh wow so it looks like it doesn't actually use so it looks like it doesn't actually use so it looks like it doesn't actually use any web framework it just any web framework it just any web framework it just does it itself creates a voucher so it uses tokyo directly for that so it uses tokyo directly for that so it uses tokyo directly for that apparently apparently apparently nuke enable build expect block one make nuke enable build expect block one make nuke enable build expect block one make service function and this is ah it uses hyper then and this is ah it uses hyper then and this is ah it uses hyper then ok so it uses hyper directly ok so it uses hyper directly ok so it uses hyper directly to create a server and it manages connections also by itself okay okay okay now syntax highlighting was another now syntax highlighting was another now syntax highlighting was another thing right thing right thing right um let's just quickly check how the how do let's just quickly check how the how do let's just quickly check how the how do we find it uh how was the we find it uh how was the we find it uh how was the attributes that we used is called so attributes that we used is called so attributes that we used is called so highlight theme right highlight theme right highlight theme right it should be mentioned in the code that it should be mentioned in the code that it should be mentioned in the code that actually cares about that so actually cares about that so actually cares about that so that's how we will find it yeah we found that's how we will find it yeah we found that's how we will find it yeah we found something called highlighting something called highlighting something called highlighting rs in a components config highlight lines so this is from syntax highlight lines so this is from syntax highlight lines so this is from syntax from this library simple way to get directly from line of simple way to get directly from line of simple way to get directly from line of text to color tokens okay solar team so okay so that happens in markdown so that happens in markdown so that happens in markdown in markup uh let's see where it's in markup uh let's see where it's in markup uh let's see where it's up so it's in config still so rendering uses intact i would imagine so rendering uses intact i would imagine so rendering uses intact i would imagine in markdown in markdown in markdown it should also have it yes so it has it should also have it yes so it has it should also have it yes so it has highlighter and then it uses highlight what is code and then it uses highlight what is code and then it uses highlight what is code block it's block it's block it's go to code block chord block is go to code block chord block is go to code block chord block is something that they also created something that they also created something that they also created themselves yes it's in markdown themselves yes it's in markdown themselves yes it's in markdown and here list of ranges the number of and here list of ranges the number of and here list of ranges the number of lines lines lines background extra syntax set highlighter background extra syntax set highlighter background extra syntax set highlighter so here we got this syntax thing so here we got this syntax thing so here we got this syntax thing and here we get the method where it and here we get the method where it and here we get the method where it highlights code highlights code highlights code so this is in rendering src so this is in rendering src so this is in rendering src markdown code blocks now for me it looks like uh now for me it looks like uh now for me it looks like uh if you look again at our search so here theme is set and sim fat so here theme is set and sim fat so here theme is set and sim fat is from binary include bytes all theme is from binary include bytes all theme is from binary include bytes all theme dump dump dump oh so it just inlines it in highlighter oh so it just inlines it in highlighter oh so it just inlines it in highlighter s so that's how it works and um and that so that's how it works and um and that so that's how it works and um and that maybe also explains why we got the maybe also explains why we got the maybe also explains why we got the big uh binary size of the whole wrapper big uh binary size of the whole wrapper big uh binary size of the whole wrapper because it aligns those themes inside because it aligns those themes inside because it aligns those themes inside some binary file and then it lies it's some binary file and then it lies it's some binary file and then it lies it's inside the zola thing itself i guess inside the zola thing itself i guess inside the zola thing itself i guess and that allows of course it to switch and that allows of course it to switch and that allows of course it to switch dynamically between different highlights dynamically between different highlights dynamically between different highlights and themes right or adding a syntax in sublime themes directory so sublime in sublime themes directory so sublime in sublime themes directory so sublime themes directory it's here oh ooh so i guess we can just add the scene shall we just do it then i guess let's create a pull request for it so let's create a pull request for it so let's create a pull request for it so [Music] is it actually vs code theme so where is it actually vs code theme so where is it actually vs code theme so where does it says though themes are does it says though themes are does it says though themes are cm editor so let's see ah it's not a visual okay okay it's like ah it's not a visual okay okay it's like ah it's not a visual okay okay it's like legacy visual studio right it's not the legacy visual studio right it's not the legacy visual studio right it's not the current visual studio i think syntax file let's check out the library itself and also uh the s code light theme because i think they also should be published somewhere right so i want to store them there or if they i want to store them there or if they i want to store them there or if they use some other things wow that i can take some time uh i wonder if i can somehow see this stuff so oh okay we got something is it uh oh okay we got something is it uh oh okay we got something is it uh but that i think but that i think but that i think is not what this scene expects right is not what this scene expects right is not what this scene expects right so this is like tm theme editor i want a varied story so seems uh it's called amber because i want to see if it uses the because i want to see if it uses the because i want to see if it uses the same format actually here's your studio light okay that looks slightly different okay that looks slightly different okay that looks slightly different so i guess maybe somebody's already converted it so okay those like additional themes i okay those like additional themes i okay those like additional themes i guess not the themes we are looking for guess not the themes we are looking for guess not the themes we are looking for um this syntax library had some um this syntax library had some um this syntax library had some pointers sublime text syntax definitions so this is like yaml file okay i think i noticed something before how i think i noticed something before how i think i noticed something before how to generate it performance it's fast blah blah performance it's fast blah blah performance it's fast blah blah uh then okay i guess we okay i guess we okay i guess we learned that this won't be an easy thing learned that this won't be an easy thing learned that this won't be an easy thing uh uh uh you need to have those so like adding the theme to the wrapper so like adding the theme to the wrapper so like adding the theme to the wrapper itself is simple itself is simple itself is simple getting the theme that visual studio getting the theme that visual studio getting the theme that visual studio code uses by default in this format is code uses by default in this format is code uses by default in this format is harder i guess they will just need to harder i guess they will just need to harder i guess they will just need to find the themes that is find the themes that is find the themes that is looking kind of similar and pleasant to looking kind of similar and pleasant to looking kind of similar and pleasant to me and just use it me and just use it me and just use it hey nn nice to see you hey nn nice to see you hey nn nice to see you so i guess what we learned today so zola turned out to be pretty cool i so zola turned out to be pretty cool i so zola turned out to be pretty cool i was able to migrate the was able to migrate the was able to migrate the website um that i have the blogs that i website um that i have the blogs that i website um that i have the blogs that i have have have to it quite quickly it still requires a to it quite quickly it still requires a to it quite quickly it still requires a bunch of bunch of bunch of css beautification i need to find a css beautification i need to find a css beautification i need to find a better syntax highlighting theme better syntax highlighting theme better syntax highlighting theme but i think it's all right and of course but i think it's all right and of course but i think it's all right and of course i still need to publish it after i i still need to publish it after i i still need to publish it after i finish making it finish making it finish making it more beautiful but what we learned today more beautiful but what we learned today more beautiful but what we learned today is that is that is that um the thing works it sometimes fails um the thing works it sometimes fails um the thing works it sometimes fails documentation documentation documentation needs some additional work but this all needs some additional work but this all needs some additional work but this all will eventually be solved i'm pretty will eventually be solved i'm pretty will eventually be solved i'm pretty sure i will try to contribute where i sure i will try to contribute where i sure i will try to contribute where i see see see a possibility for that too um and of a possibility for that too um and of a possibility for that too um and of course course course it's very impressive how fast it works it's very impressive how fast it works it's very impressive how fast it works um how easy it was to install um how easy it was to install um how easy it was to install and the code quality in repository was and the code quality in repository was and the code quality in repository was also nice we did a little bit of review also nice we did a little bit of review also nice we did a little bit of review just looking how it does a bunch of just looking how it does a bunch of just looking how it does a bunch of things things things so far it looked quite reasonable to me so far it looked quite reasonable to me so far it looked quite reasonable to me it looked quite minimal design was quite it looked quite minimal design was quite it looked quite minimal design was quite clear clear clear and easy to follow so i'm very excited and easy to follow so i'm very excited and easy to follow so i'm very excited about having such projects done about having such projects done about having such projects done in rust i think it's a sign of community in rust i think it's a sign of community in rust i think it's a sign of community really growing and ecosystem really really growing and ecosystem really really growing and ecosystem really evolving evolving evolving and yeah i'm looking forward to look to and yeah i'm looking forward to look to and yeah i'm looking forward to look to using it instead of jekyll using it instead of jekyll using it instead of jekyll thank you for watching i will see you thank you for watching i will see you thank you for watching i will see you soon soon we will start a new series soon soon we will start a new series soon soon we will start a new series about about about doing graphs with rust showing up some doing graphs with rust showing up some doing graphs with rust showing up some really cool applications of them and really cool applications of them and really cool applications of them and trying to trying to trying to show people that graphs are not as scary show people that graphs are not as scary show people that graphs are not as scary as most computer science textbooks as most computer science textbooks as most computer science textbooks will tell you so that will probably will tell you so that will probably will tell you so that will probably start next week start next week start next week and
