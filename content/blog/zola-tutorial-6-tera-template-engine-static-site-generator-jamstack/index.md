## 📋 Structured Key Takeaways

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Summary
1. Delete repetitive HTML code in the index page to prepare for looping.
2. Use the `get_section` function to retrieve data from a section page (e.g., "what we do") and store it in a variable (e.g., `services`).
3. Implement a `for` loop to iterate over the pages in the section, using the `services.pages` syntax.
4. Use variables from the page (e.g., `title`, `description`, `icon`) inside the loop to display dynamic content.
5. Utilize the `permalink` variable to create links to individual pages.
6. Load data from external sources (e.g., CSV, URL) using the `load_data` function.

## 💡 Key Insights
* Use `for` loops in Tera templates to avoid code repetition and display dynamic content.
* Retrieve data from section pages using `get_section` and from individual pages using `get_page`.
* Access variables from pages using the dot notation (e.g., `page.title`).
* Utilize the `permalink` variable to create links to individual pages.
* Load data from external sources using `load_data` to separate content from templates.
* Use `load_data` with a `path` or `url` parameter to load data from local files or remote locations.

## 🗒️ Transcript (Auto-Generated)

> Hey friends, how you doing? In the previous part, we saw how to customize our template using Terra templating language. And in this part, we will deep dive into Terra templating language to improve our website. And for that, we have added three cards to our index page, that is the home page. And you can see these three cards are exactly similar in design. But the only difference is the title is different. That is one is application development, automation and training. the description is different and also the icons are different so there are three icons let's just look at how we have added these three icons sorry these three cards so for that we'll navigate to our index or html page inside our templates and if we see inside our content block we have added three divs and how we have added is we have just copy pasted these three days and change the text inside it because they are exactly similar in design but different text inside those straight away you can see that this is repetition of code repetition of html diffs and in each language to avoid repetitions you have loops same way terra template provides you for loops to avoid repetitions but to loop on to have a loop we need some data as well and before adding the data what we'll do is we'll first delete the repetitive part we'll just delete the two extra divs because we want the same design to be looped and have different text inside it that's why we deleted the two divs and now we will get the data on which we want to loop so for getting the data what we'll do is we'll use the what we do page because we want this what we do page to replicate to be seen on our home page if we see the what we do page it has application development automation training and these three are the exact things that we want in our home page so we will get the data from this page and this what we do is a section page so to get a data from any section page inside our index.html what we'll do is we will use set to get the page that is in this case a section page so to get a section and store it inside a variable so if we see the syntax here as well it is inside the curly brace and percent we have to use set services so services is the variable and we will set it to get section that is we will get the section we will provide the path as what we do slash underscore index dot MD underscore index dot MD being this a section page that for it is underscore in resort empty and we will save this section inside a variable named as services name can be anything we have used services now this services is a section page so what we want is the data data inside these pages for looping so what we'll do is we'll add a for loop to add a loop again the uh statement syntax is same that is uh curly braces percent and inside that we'll have for service in services dot page dot pages so what we are doing is we want the single pages inside the section pages therefore we are getting services.pages and are storing it inside a variable named a service for each loop the variable the page will be saved inside service and in terra or in zola as well a block started has to end as well so what we'll do is we'll end this for block and for that again it's curly braces percent and inside that we'll use end for and this will loop what what this will do is this will loop the entire design or the entire html code that we have for the number of times there are pages inside the service so if there are four pages inside the uh what we do section this code will be repeated four times but we have three pages so if we just take a look at our website now if we just save and reload our website we can see we have three times the same text the same uh description same title same icon just the design is same and everything is same but it is appearing for n number of times and n here is the number of pages that are there inside the section page what we do now the thing is we want uh we don't want static a text right we don't want the same text to be repeated in number of times you have to change this text so what we will do is we will use the variables inside our services page so if we just take a look at one of our uh md page that is what we do md page sorry the pages inside what you do which are the single pages so we can just take a look at app development md page we see we have title description date icon etc some variables are by default and some we have added as extra so the icon and toc variables are user different variables therefore they are extra variables now we want to use these variables inside our page and these variables are there in all our pages So if we check other pages as well So if we just check the remaining three pages that is automation we can see we have the same variables including icon. If we see the third page as well that is the training page we can see that we have the training page. So if we see the training page as well you can see we have the same variables including the extra variable that is icon as well now we will use these variables inside our index.sul page and for that we will make the use of service that we have that is the page defined in service and dot the variable name so here to define uh sorry to use a variable what we have to do is we have to give two curly braces opening closing inside that we have to give the page dot the variable name so in our case the page is saved inside a variable named as service and then the variables inside those are title descriptions so we are making use of those two variables and these variables we can use anywhere we want so we want to use it inside a name tag we can use them we want to use inside a class tag we can use them so what we will do is we have defined a class for our icon and we will use a variable inside that because we want different icons if you remember and we will use the icon which is defined inside our extra part of service that is extra part of it so here we have to use dot extra dot icon title was directly there so we used dot title but if you see the icon is lying inside our extra so what we have to do is we have to use dot extra dot icon so inside our index page we are using the variables dot extra dot icon and now if we just save this and look at our website we can see that we have three different texts three different icons but the design is exactly the same so we wrote the same or just one single design and added different text to it using the help of page if we again go back to our index page we can see that there are some hrfs that there are some links so if we just click on those links uh that is the title is a link and there is also a link for read more so if we click on those link what ideally should happen is it should take us to that single page so if you click on application development it should take us to that page automation to that page and so on but currently it is not happening so to make it happen what you have to do is you have to just add the link of the page to our href and for adding a link that is in zola you get the link of a page that is the entire url of a page by the variable dot permalink so if you do page you get the entire url of that page and we'll add to our href the same that is service.permalink because our page is inside service variable now if we go to our website and click on any of the links it should take us to that particular page yep so automation is taking us to automation page and application development your application and if you click on read more it will take to the same page because the link is the same that is dot permalink this way you can have same design with different data repeating inside it so wherever you have similar kind of design but want multiple data to uh loop through it or multiple data repeat you can use loops you can get a section page just how we did by using get underscore section similarly if we wanted to have just the data from our about page which is not a section page which is a normal page so what we could have done is we could have just used get page instead of get section get page enables us to get a single page get section enable us to get the entire section and then we can use however we want that so if it's a page we can directly use the variables we don't need to loop it if it's a section and we want single pages inside that we can loop it or whatever we do whatever we want we can do it by getting the pages similarly there are different ways of getting data in zola one of another way is to use load underscore data so at times what happens is we don't want data to be fetched from other pages we want it to be fetched from csvs urls or other things so in that case what we have to do is we have to use load underscore data as we have done here so we have created a team.toml and we have loaded that inside our index space so if we just see our team.toml it's nothing but the simple toml file which has some variables what that is title name image leaders and this toml is saved inside our content directory. So if you see the path, it is content slash Toml sorry, content slash team.toml. And this Toml file we have loaded in our index space. So for that, what we have to do is we have to use load underscore data, just as we use load, uh, get, uh, get page or get section, we have to use load underscore data, then give the path by path equals to, and the path of your file starting from, if it's inside content.  should start from content slash team.toml you can directly give urls as well so if your file is located on some different server you can directly give the entire url as well for that you have to do url instead of path and it will load the uh that url for it and here we have again uh used the for loop and looped for our team members because we again did want to um like manually write uh different uh devs for same design but different text so we looped through the team's space and we have added these two cards so if you see these cards are again added by using a for loop so these are different ways through which you can get your data inside any page and also get the data from anywhere and then use for loops ifs etc in your code all right the same way that we saw loops in zola we'll also take a look a quick look at macros and macros are somewhat similar to block and extend that we saw you write a block somewhere and then you extend it in other places but macros are opposite you write a macro and use that macro in multiple places you don't overwrite it but you use that macro in different places so we'll take the same example that we saw with these three cards and we were looping through we looped and created this card right and this is the code for it this section right this whole div what we can do is that move this whole div or this whole section into a macro and then we can reuse it in multiple places so this is just an example if you have some piece of code which you want to use in suppose we want to use the same same cards or the same structure in the cards in a different page in about or demo and somewhere else so you what you have to do is you have to rewrite this thing in the about.html or you have to write it in a block and then take that block and overwrite it or something like that but what you can do is to reduce that redundancy as well to reduce the repetitive part even in that case you can take this whole thing and put it in a macro and you can imagine macros as functions and you can reuse it in multiple places so we'll see how to do that so the starting point that you have to do is to create a file inside your templates directory so go to your templates directory and create a file it can be any name so we name it as my macros Right And what you have to do is go back to your index page copy the thing that you want to put in the uh macro so we will take this whole div copy the whole div and then move it here right we'll fix the indentation here and what we want is to use this macro in multiple places so first we have to create a macro and to do that that you have to define the macro name so the same syntax we have curly braces and inside you have to use two percentages and write the thing between so we will write that this is a macro so we'll say macro um what was the syntax macro equals to or something vision macro yeah i think it is take it out on zola.org and go to zola and then i think it is part of Terra, so you have to write Terra, Terra macros. You can even find an example in your own theme. So if I go to my theme templates, so themes, deep thought, and then templates, we'll see, there is a macros.html there, and you can. Uh, check the example from here. Like the social links is a macro here that is defined. and then you have a published metadata in the first or in the second video we saw that we removed a row from the post or the section page which was showing some page metadata like number of minutes to read that page the author's name etc so that was defined in a macro and we removed that function call basically from the section page in our templates so this is the way to define a macro and we'll copy this line we'll put it in our macros file so you have to use uh the same curly braces percentage thing and then in between you write macro and the name of the macro so in our case we'll name it as service uh cards section and then we will take a variable uh services So, I will let I want to spell it yeah services and I will remove this part this is the variable this is the part where we were taking getting the way section from the what we do part and we were using get section. So we will move that we will remove that save this will go back to index and paste it here right And we are still using the same get section and we are still getting services that And we creating a variable services And now what I can do is use this macro service cards and call this as a function and pass the services variable here So to do that, you can do percentage and then call macro. To call a macro, you have to say macro. I think it is the same way. yeah macro and then double colon yeah so you have to say macro double colon and then the name of the macro so it is service cards and then give services equals to services so this means take this variable and pass it as services to service card so it this variable can be anything we could have changed it to my service i think but we have to still call it as services equals to and then this variables so this is corresponding to this variable right one thing before calling a service or before calling any function in a programming language you have to import that function right so we have not imported this macro here and if we run this it will not work so first we have to import our macro and to do that you have to write percentage page think and then same i think it is import so we have created our file as my macros dot html you have to directly give the name of the macros file inside your templates directory and then you can import it as something so we'll import it as my macros right and to use the functions under this my macros file you have to call this my macros and colon the name so we have written it as macros but we'll change it as my macros colon service cards and we are passing the services variable let's save this we have made a lot of changes we'll check if the server is still running okay we see that there is an error okay so the syntax to use a macro or a function is same as variables, it's not this way to write statement, what you have to do is you have to write it as variables, you have to call this, you have to pass it double curly braces and then call the macro. And if we save it, it should run. Okay, what is there Okay just as I mentioned any block that you create in solar there or terra templates you have to end that block so we have started this macro service and it is also a block and we have created the service we have started it but we have not told where it is ending so we have to say we have to pass we have to create a tag here as well and say end macro yeah so we are ending it it. Now if we see okay, it is reloaded properly. If we go back to it crazy. Okay, we are seeing it twice. You need to see why is that we have service looping through it. And if I go back here we are calling it once ah i did not delete the original code the original div so you can see that it is exactly same and we can just remove our original div completely because we have moved the code to a macro and we can reuse this anywhere in our website we just have to pass it a section variable as just services in this case and that will render three so if we save this it should be just three now yeah so it will just render these three cards so in this manner you can write or create code which you can call anywhere like functions in multiple places with different variables okay till this point if you have followed along with us with all the zola tutorial videos you should be able to easily create your website you should be easily able to customize if you have used a theme in zola and you can easily load data from different place places and use it in different places in your website so in the next video we will actually build or finally create a build release build of our project of our static website and then we will show you how you can deploy the final release that you have we will use gitlab or netlify service to deploy our website and see it in action you can even check the url and use it and see it live how it looks like and how it works if you have any doubts till now or if you have any problems with zola or any static site generator in general you can comment below and we will try to help you out thank you

## 📝 Full Article Narrative

Introduction

In the world of web development, creating a professional website can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to managing and displaying dynamic content. However, with the help of static site generators like Zola, building a website can be made easier and more efficient. In this article, we will explore how to use the Tera template engine in Zola to improve the HTML code of our website and make it more dynamic. We will also discuss how to retrieve data from different pages and sources, and how to use variables from front matter in our HTML pages.

As part of a series on building a professional website for ITcracy using Zola, a static site generator based on the Jamstack architecture, this article will provide a deep dive into the Tera template engine. By the end of this article, readers will have a better understanding of how to use Tera to create dynamic content, retrieve data from different sources, and improve the overall design of their website. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced web developer, this article will provide valuable insights and practical tips on how to get the most out of the Tera template engine.

One of the key benefits of using Tera is its ability to avoid code repetition and display dynamic content using loops. In this article, we will explore how to use `for` loops in Tera templates to retrieve data from section pages and display it in a dynamic and efficient way. We will also discuss how to access variables from pages using dot notation and how to utilize the `permalink` variable to create links to individual pages.

### Using Tera to Improve HTML Code

To start using Tera to improve our HTML code, we need to delete any repetitive code and prepare our index page for looping. This involves removing any duplicate HTML code and setting up our page to retrieve data from a section page. We can use the `get_section` function to retrieve data from a section page, such as the "what we do" page, and store it in a variable. We can then use a `for` loop to iterate over the pages in the section and display dynamic content.

### Retrieving Data from Section Pages

To retrieve data from a section page, we can use the `get_section` function and store the data in a variable. We can then use this variable to access the pages in the section and display dynamic content. For example, if we have a section page called "what we do" with three sub-pages, we can use the `get_section` function to retrieve the data from this page and store it in a variable called `services`. We can then use a `for` loop to iterate over the pages in the `services` variable and display dynamic content.

### Using Variables from Front Matter

To use variables from front matter in our HTML pages, we can access them using dot notation. For example, if we have a page with a variable called `title`, we can access it using `page.title`. We can also use variables from the `extra` section of our page, such as `icon`, by accessing them using `page.extra.icon`. By using variables from front matter, we can make our HTML code more dynamic and efficient.

### Loading Data from External Sources

In addition to retrieving data from section pages, we can also load data from external sources using the `load_data` function. This allows us to separate our content from our templates and make our website more dynamic. For example, we can load data from a CSV file or a URL and use it to display dynamic content on our website. By using the `load_data` function, we can make our website more efficient and easier to manage.

In conclusion, the Tera template engine is a powerful tool for building dynamic and efficient websites. By using `for` loops, retrieving data from section pages, using variables from front matter, and loading data from external sources, we can create a website that is both professional and easy to manage. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced web developer, this article has provided valuable insights and practical tips on how to get the most out of the Tera template engine.
