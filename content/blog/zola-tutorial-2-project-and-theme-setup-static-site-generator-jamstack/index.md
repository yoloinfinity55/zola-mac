> hey friends how you doing this is a series on how to build or how to create a website using zola and in the previous part that is the first part we saw what we want to do that is we want to build a website and why did we choose zola that is the static site generator over traditional web technologies like wordpress django sites etc and in this part we are actually going to see zola in action that is we'll init a project and then use a theme inside it and see how exactly zola fits into it and how zola helps us so to start with we'll have to first install zola and to do that the best way is to go to zola.org get zola.org that is the official documentation the links will be there in the description itself and you have to go to the docs and then to the installation part and there you will see installation instructions based on your operating system and your distribution so you can simply follow those instructions and the simplest way we would suggest is to go to the github release pages and download the binary based on your distribution and your operating system if you have any issues or any questions to ask about installations and other things you can do you can mention them in the comments and we will get back to you as soon as possible now we will go by the simplest way that is we will download the binary which we have already downloaded and after downloading the binary you can add it to your path and then you can directly use it as typing zola and then the version we already have it in our path so we can directly use it or else you can directly enter the entire path we have it in our user bin so you can type like this user bin zola and then use it okay now we have to start a new project so we have to do is init so zola space init and the project name in this case it will be our website that is the itgracy website so itgracy we can go with itgracy website when you do init it asks you a few questions that is what is the URL of your site the base URL it can be anything in our case it is a CDP s I degree C dot com it can be your own website as well and it also asks us some other questions as well like whether you want sass compilation or no we can leave it to default that is yes it also asks you if you want syntax highlighting if you want search index and etc we leave it to defaults and all the things now what happens is all these uh questions and the answers they are customizable they are changeable you can change them later as well so if you just see the structure that the init has built for us it will be like this you have different files the config.toml and different folders as well so the config.toml if we just check if we do config.toml these are all the options that were asked when we did init we can change them whenever we want there are other options as well which we'll be looking as we go ahead in this series and you can also have a look if you want before ending the docs of the zola as well so these all are really customizable and you can change them whenever you want now what we'll do is we'll actually see how the default or the init structure looks like for that what we can do is we can do zola serve what this zola serve does this it builds your website it compiles your website and it serves it on localhost uh one one one one that is four times one so this is really helpful for you when you are developing website like in this case so you can live see your changes as we don't have any templates or any anything at all in our uh nave zola code you can see that zola has a by default uh template page for us you can see that it also mentions you are seeing this page because we couldn't find a template to render and we can modify this page we can create new index.htm we can change the theme we can install a theme as well and that's what we are going to do now is install a theme so we'll start by installing a theme and to install theme the link is given here if we open that shows you how you can install a theme. You have to select the theme from the themes link that they have and you can just clone it in the themes directory. We saw that there was a directory in our website structure themes and you just have to cd into themes and then you can clone the theme that you want so we select a theme for us and we liked which one deep thought okay we are going to use ah sorry it's something else you can choose whichever theme you want deep thought is the that we like you can go with others as well yep and it has a github link you can just open that and they have the instructions here as well but the instruction in theme installation you can go to themes installing and using themes we saw that it was seeding into themes and then cloning the repository that you want so in our case it's deep thought i can just copy this url or you can copy it from here as well copy it and then go to themes we are in themes directory and we can do hit clone and then paste the url this will clone the theme directory the tip.directory directory into our themes themes folder and to use the theme like mentioned in the documentation for using a theme you have to set a theme variable in the configuration file to the name of the directory that you have inside themes folder so i'll just go back a directory structure we'll open the config dot toml file and we'll add a variable down here not here i guess it's at the top level to add it here team equals to and we'll name it as deep hot i guess this was the name that we had if we see inside themes directory deep part and our config this is case sensitive so it should be exactly the same yep and it looks that we have it and if i now do serve to check whether our theme was installed. Says that failed to render happened. Navibars item. Ah, OK. To run that, there are a few instructions in GitHub page you can check. So what he says that you need to have Navibars items in a few configuration items which you need to add into your config and for now as an example we just copy this full thing and not required for everyone it depends on which theme you choose so each theme will have its own uh config options and other styles etc so this is for the theme that we have chosen so as per the documentation maybe we can just try to copy it here and save it and we close and then sola serve okay item.code not found in context while rendering ht index.html append in parent template let's just check the github page once again so you don't add a default language to this array. So I guess you need to have a language code. Okay, not include here. Okay. So what happens is that we have added the navbar items, but we don't have a default language and I think this deep thought is a multilingual theme so that you can have multiple languages for your website in our case it's just in English for now so we can copy the full part and replace this thing with the English part and we'll delete and spanish ones that's all we can even keep just for showing purpose as well now let's try again if it works zola serve okay that worked and now we can just reload this ah cool so we have the the theme working. Do we have an example post? There is nothing in because we have not added any content to it. But this is how you get the themes working. And in the future videos or in the next part, we will try to configure all the options and add some contents so that our website looks nice, I guess. Thank you.

## 📝 Full Article Narrative

Introduction

Welcome to the second installment of our series on building a professional website using Zola, a static site generator based on the Jamstack architecture. In our previous article, we explored the reasons behind choosing Zola over traditional web technologies and what we aim to achieve with our project. In this article, we will dive into the world of Zola and start building our project from scratch. We will create a new project using Zola's init command, explore the directory structure, and install a theme to give our website a professional look.

To get started with Zola, we need to install it on our system. The easiest way to do this is by downloading the binary from the GitHub release page and adding it to our system's path. Once installed, we can verify that Zola is working correctly by checking its version. With Zola installed, we can now create a new project using the `zola init` command. This command will prompt us to answer a few questions, such as the URL of our site and whether we want to enable features like Sass compilation and syntax highlighting. These options can be customized later, so we can stick with the default settings for now.

Creating a New Project and Installing a Theme

When we run the `zola init` command, Zola creates a new directory structure for our project, including a `config.toml` file that contains our project's configuration settings. We can explore this directory structure and configuration file to get a better understanding of how Zola works. To preview our website, we can use the `zola serve` command, which builds and serves our website on localhost. Since we haven't added any templates or content yet, Zola displays a default page with a message indicating that it couldn't find a template to render. This is where we can start customizing our website by installing a theme.

### Installing a Theme

To install a theme, we need to clone a repository into the `themes` directory and configure the `config.toml` file to use the theme. We can choose from a variety of themes available on the Zola website, each with its own configuration options and requirements. For our example, we will use the "Deep Thought" theme, which is a multilingual theme that supports multiple languages. To install the theme, we clone the repository into the `themes` directory and add a `theme` variable to the `config.toml` file, specifying the name of the theme directory. However, when we try to serve our website, we encounter an error message indicating that the theme requires additional configuration options.

### Troubleshooting and Configuration

To resolve the error, we need to consult the theme's documentation and add the required configuration options to our `config.toml` file. In this case, we need to add navbar items and specify a default language for our website. Since the "Deep Thought" theme is a multilingual theme, we can configure it to support multiple languages, but for our example, we will stick with English. Once we have added the required configuration options, we can try serving our website again. This time, the theme should work correctly, and we should see our website displayed with the new theme.

Conclusion

In this article, we have taken the first steps in building our professional website using Zola. We have installed Zola, created a new project, and installed a theme to give our website a professional look. We have also learned how to configure the theme and troubleshoot errors that may occur during the installation process. In our next article, we will continue to configure our website, add content, and explore more features of Zola. With Zola's customizable project structure and configuration file, we can create a website that meets our specific needs and requirements. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Zola provides a powerful and flexible tool for building fast, secure, and scalable websites.
