## 🧭 Introduction
Welcome to our Zola tutorial series, where we're building a professional website for ITcracy using the Zola static site generator based on the Jamstack architecture. In this article, we'll be focusing on extending and modifying templates in Zola. If you're new to Zola, don't worry, we'll take it one step at a time. By the end of this article, you'll have a solid understanding of how to customize your website's templates to fit your needs. We'll be covering the basics of Zola's template language, Tera, and how to use it to modify your website's layout.

In our previous tutorials, we covered the basics of Zola and how to create a new website. We also explored the concept of templates and how they're used in Zola. Now, it's time to dive deeper into the world of templates and learn how to extend and modify them to create a unique look and feel for your website. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this article will provide you with the practical knowledge you need to take your website to the next level.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Summary
Here's a step-by-step summary of what we'll be covering in this article:
1. **Understanding Zola's template requirements**: We'll explore the three essential templates that Zola needs to work: `index.html`, `section.html`, and `page.html`.
2. **Extending templates with Tera**: We'll learn how to use Tera's `extends` syntax to modify existing templates without changing the original code.
3. **Modifying the navbar template**: We'll walk through the process of modifying the navbar template to add a custom logo.
4. **Customizing the home page content**: We'll learn how to modify the home page content by changing the text that appears on the page.
5. **Using Zola's default variables**: We'll explore how to use Zola's default variables, such as `content`, to display dynamic content on our website.
6. **Working with Tera's block syntax**: We'll learn how to use Tera's block syntax to override specific parts of a template.

## 💡 Key Insights
Here are the key takeaways from this article:
* **Zola requires at least three templates**: `index.html`, `section.html`, and `page.html` are the minimum templates required for Zola to work.
* **Tera's `extends` syntax is powerful**: We can use Tera's `extends` syntax to modify existing templates without changing the original code.
* **Blocks are reusable**: Tera's block syntax allows us to override specific parts of a template, making it easy to customize our website's layout.
* **Zola's default variables are useful**: We can use Zola's default variables, such as `content`, to display dynamic content on our website.
* **Customizing templates is easy**: With Tera's syntax and Zola's default variables, customizing templates is a straightforward process.
* **Modifying templates requires attention to detail**: When modifying templates, it's essential to pay attention to the syntax and the variables used to ensure that our changes take effect as expected.

> Hello friends, how are you doing? In the last part, we saw how we can add content to the website and we created a normal page about and what we do, a section page. And we took a look at templates in a very simple way. But now we'll go into a bit more depth about templates and Terra template language of Zola. so we'll start by modifying our home page and we'll for that we have to modify the template which is rendering the home page and we'll start with the navbar as you can see this is the default navbar that we get with the deep thought theme and we want to change or we want to add our logo here besides our name it crazy so for that we need to first search the template which is rendering the navbar that we see here so let's go into our project this is the directory structure and since our template is coming from our theme we'll go to our themes and then deep thought the directory and then templates okay we saw the saw this last time as well we had page and section html which we were using and we copied this over to our templates and named it something else so that we can use it in places that we don't want the bar that we had but now we'll look we will learn more about these templates and how it works so first in zola for zola to work it will need at least three templates it will look for three templates with the names as index.html section.html and page.html last time we saw that page.html for was responsible for rendering normal pages like the about and the section.html was responsible to render the listing pages like this one so the third one which is the index.html this is responsible to for rendering your home page or your main page with that you see when you visit your website So we are interested now in homepage So we go into index we open it and we look for navbar if we can search here and you can see that there is nothing uh there navbar is not present here it's just some uh header and a section block but uh look closely this this syntax this weird syntax with curly braces percentage and then in between something that is terra templates and terra allows you to extend other templates so basically index.html is extending from base.html and then you are overwriting some blocks so blocks are these blocks are present in base.html and you are overwriting these blocks and adding some content of your own okay and we'll we'll uh we'll understand more when we will overwrite our block which is navbar for us so let's first open base.html and it's in the same location as index.html we'll open it and now you can see that there is um more html here it has a head tag it has meta link etc etc and it is also mixed with terra template language as well which which allows you to write if else normal programming syntax we'll take a look at them as well let's first search for navbar and we'll scroll down there is a script tag the head is ending here and then you can see there's a body tag and inside body the first tag that we see is the navbar okay and it's inside a block called navbar and this is responsible for rendering our navbar in our website let's for us to add our image or the logo of itigressi here we need to change this navbar but as we saw last time we don't want to directly change in the themes template because if you change here and then if you want to update your template your theme when you update your changes will be lost so there is a better way of extending and modifying your themes template all you have to do is create your own template with the same name as base So we go back to our directory website directory and then there is templates here And here we can create a new file called as base.html. Okay. And now we only want to change or we only want to add some content to navbar. we don't want to change anything else the other parts that we see here so terra allows you to extend a template and then change some part of it so we'll say extends and then we have to give the path of the template that we want to extend so this is the syntax for extending a template and we have to give a path so it is deep and the path should start from themes or from your templates directory so we don't have it in our template strategy but we have it inside the deep thought theme so we'll give deep thought slash templates slash base dot html so we are extending the this file based on html in our templates based on html so we'll get all the contents which are present in base.snl and if we run it like this and don't we'll not change anything just run it and if I go back to yeah it's running and if I refresh nothing will change because we just extended it but we did not make any changes to it it is as it is that it is just a copy of this base.html that we have right now now let's try to change something and we'll change the navbar so we'll say block navbar and this this should be exactly same as the block defined in base.html and if we search for navbar here you can see there is a block navbar thing and we want to define the same thing here and each block will will have a name of its own and it should start with block and end with end block so you have to give this so in between whatever changes or whatever thing that you add will be added to the uh to this part so this part basically if i maybe I can move it to top here. So if I make, if I add something here, this nav tag or this part inside the end block and navbar block will be replaced Suppose I leave it as empty and save it will if we go back you can see that the navbar is gone because we have overwritten the block with an empty string we have nothing inside it so but we don't want to remove it we want to have the same navbar but we want to add the image so let's copy the nav from here we'll select the whole nav tag copy it go back and paste it here if i save again should come back and with no changes because we just copied it okay now we want to add our image here so we have to make we have to change this tag that you see here it's a link tag and this tag is showing your title here and you can see it's a it has a href as something and this curly braces that you see it's teras syntax of adding variables or using variables so these variables we saw that it was these were they were they were defined in config.toml if you want we can open it as well and you can see we have the top two variables as base url title and here you can use it as config.baseurl and config.title so in zola to use temp to use variables from config you have to start with config and then use them so we want to change this tag right i'll just copy it and paste here sorry and paste here so what i'm doing is keeping the same link tag and just replacing the content of the link tag with that same title but adding an image along with it so it's a html syntax of adding image and we are also using a variable here again and we will be using avatar as our variable right how the variable is used you can see that it says config.extra.author.author the reason for that is if you go to config.toml you can see these are the these variables are the main variables which are part of zola and you can directly use saying that config. and then the name of the variable but the variables under extra you have to use them as config.extra  we again have extra.author so this becomes becomes a new section inside extra so you have to use the variables inside author by saying config.extra.author.name or avatar okay so that's why we are using it like this config.extra.author.avatar and we'll save this let's go back you can see our our logo is now coming up here we just have some css and html to make it appear in this format here we will we will even make it better in future that will be just normal css and html so that is how you can extend uh part of your index html or of your base html and make changes to your template now just as we customized our navbar we will customize some more content on our home page we will customize the we will change the text that is appearing here our team is specializing in and for doing that uh we'll have to follow the same steps that is we'll first check where exactly is this text coming from we'll first check our index.html and see if it is coming from there and we can go into our themes and then into the index.html first we'll go and we'll check and yep we can see there is a block content if you see the same this is the same block same type of block that we saw for navbar so syntax provided by terra and inside that block you can see there is some content and it is inside a variable defined by double curly braces opening and closing which we just now showed you so section.content if we see now from where this variable is appearing this section dot content so for that we have to see the zola's default variables and content is one of the default variable provided by zola and it is a special type of variable where if you remember we had told you that inside our content variable if we sorry inside our content directory if we create underscore index.md page so this represents our main page or the home page uh content that we want so if you go inside this underscore index dot mdp we see some text some markdown written after the triple pluses so if you see a team specializing in then we have a building websites and etc so all this whatever is there outside of this triple pluses is treated as content and it appears or it gets saved into the content variable which we can directly use by referring to it so if here we see section dot content then this content will contain entire thing that we have inside our content that is outside of this triple pluses and this section is because it is an underscore index dot md so it is referred us directly section because it's a home page and it's a section business therefore it is section dot content and it is a variable therefore the double curly braces now if you see there is something written after the content that is it is a pipe and written as safe so what this this does is if we just uh remove this and check our website what happens is you will get to understand what exactly it is used for so we have removed the save now if we check our website we can see at first we had the content displayed properly but now we have the entire html rendered as text so if you see there is an h2 tag there is id there is ul li etc all these are html parts but this is rendered as text so to tell zola that it is safe to render this this html you have to give pipe space safe so what this pipe space safe will do is it will tell zola that it is safe to render this content in whatever format is coming so if it is coming as an html form it is safe to render this and if we add the safe and again we check the website we will see that we have the text properly as list items and headings and text as well now we will change this for that again what we have to do is we have to overwrite this content block but as you already know that we don't overwrite it in our main theme theme page what we do is we go to our website uh templates for that we'll navigate to our website and then the template and inside that we will create a new file which is index.html so we'll kill the same file just as we wanted to extend the base html we created a base html page the similar way we'll extend the index.html page by creating an index.html page inside our theme inside our template directory. So index will create an inside that What we do is we will extend the index of our theme so for that again the syntax will be curly braces percent and inside that we will extend our themes index page so it is deep thought so starting from the theme folder deep thought slash and then templates and then the index.html so it tells that we want to extend this page from our theme and below that what we will do is we will create our block which displays the content so in this case the block is named as content you can have any name to your block the names are not uh uh specific or names are not uh default names you can have any so you can have block xyz you can have block text block folder anything anything that you want you can name so after the block it is the name of the block so inside this now we will if you just uh render this like if you just save this and if you serve it you can see what happens just as we saw with the navbar we can see it appears as blank because we don't have any content inside this so what we'll do is we'll add some cards and some text inside this just because we want our website to be displayed in a specific way we'll add our own content so this is nothing but just simple devs and classes and etc this is simple html you can add any html that you want but we are adding two cards three cards for us and if we just save it and render it you can see we have a progress bar as we had added a progress bar and we have three cards with text appearing in each card so first text appears as hello world and there is foobar and then third column so this is nothing but plain html simple html you can have any html that you want but we wanted a progress bar and three cards so we have added uh progress bar and three cards if we just see our html file one index.html file once again we can just see that inside our block content we have this so if we just again navigate to our themes uh i'm just repeating myself that if we again navigate to our themes index.html we can see that the content block has something else but just because we have overridden it in our index.html template it is showing what we have in our theme in our websites uh template so the you can notice here that the order of displaying is first Zola will check your template directory and see if it has the pages and the blocks that it wants And if it finds it will use those blocks and if it does not find those blocks then it will navigate to your themes jtree and search for its default templates and default blocks and then it will render it that way now in the same way we will add some more html and css structure to our home page and let's see how it will look and this is how it looks it we have changed the image and also the text we have added a different image to it and we have also added uh some cards two cards showing our own faces and a progress bar above that as well and it is nothing but just change of our addition of extra html and css if we look at our index.html page we can see there is another block named as header so there was this block in the themes index.html we have if you just go to themes index.html we can see there is this headers block so we have uh as we have extended this uh html page we also over right we also have overridden this header block and we have changed it to what we just saw and also uh below we have added two cards it is just simple html and added our own images as well and yep this is how you can extend any template anywhere and also override the blocks inside it so if you have to build a website like this you can really use this power of blocks and extending through which you don't have to rewrite your codes again and again you just define blocks and then you can change it in different pages wherever you want and now if we check our index.html page we can see that we have directly added the content inside our html page only so content means we have added the text and images directly inside our html page so here in the new templates that we have added we have not used or harnessed the power of terra template engine and zola so in the next part what we will do is we will modify or change our templates in such a way that we will use the power of zola and terad templates to enable us to change the content without changing anything in our html page so using just md files and config files we'll be able to change the content that we want inside these pages and that's what you are going to look in our next video
